<h2>People</h2>
    The project is a large collaboration between lots of people, and would not 
be possible without any one of them. The aims of bugbank have been conceived 
and pursued principally by:

    <h3>David Wyllie</h3><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1G2agqa8EMHZvNilJfXZPJWEuDancJAVo" align="right" width="46"><p>David 
is Consultant Microbiologist at Public Health England. Besides his 
clinical specialism in microbiology, he is an academic at the <a href="https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/principal-investigators/researcher/david-wyllie">University of 
Oxford</a> with expertise in molecular biology, genetics and computing.

    <h3>Anne-Marie O'Connell</h3><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1i5B5_wJHbAuNZnPc7i9AZBRugl9bLwmK" align="right" width="46"><p>Anne-Marie 
is Head of Information Management at the National Infection Service 
within PHE. She is the chief architect of PHE's microbiology database, and has 
worked tirelessly to integrate the diverse daily feeds from English hospitals' 
microbiology labs into a central resource at PHE headquarters in Colindale, 
London.

    <h3>Naomi Allen</h3><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1TayAm8pBkQcoHCXl2fymvUctryRyyy-n" align="right" width="46"><p>Naomi

 and Chief Scientist at 
UK Biobank. She has been instrumental in the development of the UK Biobank, 
which is one of the world's largest studies of environmental and genetic risk 
factors for common diseases, following around half a million people over time 
for over a decade.

    <h3>Daniel Wilson</h3><img src="mewed.jpg" align="right" width="46"><p>Daniel is Sir Henry 
Dale Fellow and Big Data Institute Robertson Fellow at the University of 
Oxford. Within bugbank, he is developing logistical infrastructure for 
collecting germs from UK Biobank participants and data analysis methods for the 
joint analysis of human and pathogen genetics to better understand risk factors 
for infection.
