		<h2>Welcome to my home page</h2>
		<p>I have included details of my research interests, publications, CV and how to 
			contact me. I am currently a Research Associate in the population genetics of 
			infectious disease at Lancaster University.</p>
		<p>Based in the Department of Maths and Statistics, I am working with Paul 
			Fearnhead, Gareth Roberts and Peter Diggle on the epidemiology of human cases 
			of Campylobacter, a common bacterial infection that causes gastroenteritis. The 
			project is funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
			(DEFRA).</p>
		<p>In September 2005 I completed my doctorate in the population genetics of 
			meningitis, which was supervised by Gil McVean and Martin Maiden of the Peter 
			Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Oxford. Part of this research looked at 
			detecting natural selection in gene sequences more generally, details are 
			below.</p>
		<p>Please contact me if you have any comments or questions about the website or my 
			research.</p>

		<h3>Estimating diversifying selection and functional constraint in the presence of 
			recombination</h3>
		<p>omegaMap is a method for estimating variation in the dN/dS ratio within a gene 
			in the presence of recombination. Click <a href="software.html">here</a> to
